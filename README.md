### 🎯 **Architecture Principles**
- **Modular Design:** Each file has a single, clear responsibility
- **Separation of Concerns:** UI, logic, validation, and storage layers are separated
- **Reusability:** 25+ UI components used throughout the application
- **Clean Code:** Readable, maintainable, and well-documented code

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryancodes12/Authentication-System.git
cd Authentication-System
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application**
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📖 User Guide

### Main Menu
On launch, you'll see three options:
```
[1] Login
[2] Register new User
[3] Exit
```

### Registration Process
1. Select option `2` from the main menu
2. Enter your details:
   - **First Name** and **Last Name**
   - **Email Address** (must contain @gmail.com)
   - **Username** (must be unique, lowercase)
   - **Password** (requirements below)
   - **Confirm Password**

**Password Requirements:**
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one number
- At least one special character (@_!#$%^&*)
- Cannot match username

### Login
1. Select option `1` from the main menu
2. Enter your **username** or **email**
3. Enter your **password**
   - You have 3 attempts before being locked out
   - Failed attempts show remaining tries

### Dashboard Features
After successful login:

**[1] View Profile** - Display your account information
- Name, email, username
- Account status

**[2] Update Name** - Change your display name
- Enter new name
- Instant update

**[3] Change Password** - Update your password
- Verify current password
- Enter new password (must meet requirements)
- Confirm new password

**[4] Delete Account** - Coming in Phase 4

**[5] Logout** - End your session safely

## 🎨 UI Components

- `menu_panel()` - Numbered menu options
- `profile_table()` - User profile data table
- `space()` - Spacing between elements
- `rule()` - Horizontal divider lines

### Feedback Components
- `success()` / `success_panel()` - Green success messages
- `error()` / `error_panel()` - Red error messages
- `warn()` / `warn_panel()` - Yellow warnings
- `info()` - Cyan information messages

### Interactive Components
- `get_input()` - Text input with colored prompts
- `get_choice()` - Menu selection

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Current Security Features
✅ Password validation (length, complexity)  
✅ Login attempt limiting (3 tries)  
✅ Session state management  
✅ Input sanitization  
✅ Username uniqueness checks  

### ⚠️ Security Limitations (Educational Project)

**DO NOT use in production without implementing:**
- ❌ Password hashing (currently plain text)
- ❌ Database encryption
- ❌ HTTPS/SSL
- ❌ Rate limiting
- ❌ Email verification
- ❌ Two-factor authentication
- ❌ Password reset mechanism

These features are planned for future phases (see Roadmap).
